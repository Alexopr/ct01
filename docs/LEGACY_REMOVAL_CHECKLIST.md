# Legacy Code Removal Verification Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive checklist to verify that all functionality from the legacy `alg.coyote001` package has been successfully migrated to the new DDD architecture (`com.ct01`) before proceeding with code removal.

**Legacy Package**: `alg.coyote001` (124 Java files)  
**Target Architecture**: `com.ct01.crypto` (DDD-based)  
**Migration Task**: 41.10 - Execute Legacy Code Removal

## Removal Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Final Verification (Pre-Removal)
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute all unit, integration, and performance tests
2. **Production Smoke Test**: Verify all critical endpoints in production
3. **Database Backup**: Create complete database backup before removal
4. **Feature Flag Check**: Ensure all legacy routing is disabled

### Phase 2: Legacy Code Removal
1. **Package Removal**: Delete `alg.coyote001` package
2. **Import Cleanup**: Remove all references to legacy classes
3. **Configuration Cleanup**: Remove legacy-specific configurations
4. **Build Verification**: Ensure application compiles successfully

### Phase 3: Post-Removal Verification
1. **Application Startup**: Verify application starts without errors
2. **API Functional Test**: Execute comprehensive API test suite
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to staging and production
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor application performance for 24-48 hours

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation
1. **Dead Code Removal**: Clean up any orphaned files or configurations
2. **Documentation Update**: Update all references to legacy code
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Brief team on the new architecture
4. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned from migration

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Hidden Dependencies**: Some legacy code may be referenced indirectly
2. **Configuration Conflicts**: Legacy configurations may still be active
3. **Database Constraints**: Foreign key references to legacy entities
4. **External Dependencies**: Third-party integrations expecting legacy endpoints

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test layers to catch issues early
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to staging before production
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during and after removal
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to quickly restore legacy code if needed
